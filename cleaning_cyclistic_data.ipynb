    "Now, some new columns were added to the table, to help the upcoming analysis. From the columns `started_at` and `ended_at`, which contained data about the day and time its ride started and ended, the columns `date_started_at`, `time_started_at`, `date_ended_at` and `time_ended_at` were created which separate the date from the time. In addition, the columns `ride_length_in_seconds` and `ride_length` were add, which represented the duration of each ride in seconds and in hhh:mm:ss format respectively. Another column, named `day_of_week`, was add showing the day of week for each ride in a range from 1 up to 7, where 1 is for Sunday and 7 for Saturday. From columns containing information about the longitude and latitude of the starting and ending stations corresponding columns with the appropriate representation of the coordinates were added. For the columns `start_station_name`, `start_station_id`, `end_station_name` and `end_station_id` new columns with no extra spaces at the beginning, end and middle were added. The figure 4 i -v shows the corresponding queries\n",
